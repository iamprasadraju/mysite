# What is Sorting ?

A **Sorting Algorithm** is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.
The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.


**Sorting Algorithm**


1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Heap sort


## Selection Sort

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <span style="max-width: 60%; line-height: 1.5;">
    <strong>Selection Sort</strong> is a simple, in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm. 
    It works by repeatedly finding the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted portion 
    of the list and placing it at the beginning (or end) of the sorted portion.

### Step-by-step Example:

```text
Initial array:      64  25  12  22  11

Step 1 (min 11):   <11> 25  12  22  64
Step 2 (min 12):    11 <12> 25  22  64
Step 3 (min 22):    11  12 <22> 25  64
Step 4 (min 25):    11  12  22 <25> 64
Step 5 (done):      11  12  22  25 <64>
```
