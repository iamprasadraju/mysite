# Trigger

**Monitor -> Analyze -> Notify**


1. Playwright - To crawl the html like browser like behaviour
2. Github Workflow - To runs script every interval (Free)
3. Firebase Cloud Messaging (if already as app) else Telegram wins / Telegram(Bot - api) - For notifications


**Design Decisions:**

1. Find API or json endpoints better compared with Browser Emulators.

2. For static websites, it is better to use `requets`. For Dynamic websites use Playwright(Fast) or selenium web driver(slower).Because some website crawling and scrapping.

3. Optional: For Storage use SQLite, Redis.
